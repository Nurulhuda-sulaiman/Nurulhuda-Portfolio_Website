* Using Tableau as visulisation tool, 92% of users tracked and are active, users are active on Sundays and the more time of activity, more calories are burned
* Some limitations is that there are only 33 users, 22 of them logged their sleep times and only 8 logged their weight. No demographic data is also provided
